#Pre-requisites

Need to yarn or npm all the packages used for this application.

#Running the application

yarn run start - will run all the tests and run the application in local server.

#Built With

emotion (for styled components) - CSS in JS library
redux - for the global state managemet
jest- for testing
typescript- (workspace vertion 3.3.3333)

#Operations

Adding new customer and Searching customer operations are available in the landing page.

Deleting and editing an existing customer will be available as the user proceed to the searching operation.

#Limitations

Due to time constraints, there are only minimal test cases and less validation.
Additionally the code can be way optimised by breaking down the main page for the application 'Customer.tsx' into smaller functional components.

Eventhough it is a small application, I have implemented redux store concept to exhibit my understanding about redux.
